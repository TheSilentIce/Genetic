TODO:
---Implement CMake for proper cross-platform use
---Implement GPU acceleration for Genetic Algorithm
---Implement GPU Accleration for PyTorch
---Implement parallel processing as necessary
---Finish Genetic Algorithm
---Rework LSTM Model with actually decent code

--------------------------------------------

CONSIDERATIONS AND POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS TO IMPLEMENT:

---Instead of trying to predict absolute prices, perhaps predict return rates
Example: Instead of LSTM predicting Day 1 -> $5.50, Day 2 -> $5.60
We could instead do Day 1 -> +3%, Day 2 -> -4%
Why: No matter the type of stock, whether its berkshire or AAPL, we'll always be dealing in percentages
It'll create consistency, and we won't have to worry about the LSTM predicting some ludicrous number because
our training data uses stocks of various prices.

---Implement a LSTM confidence rating:
Alongside the price or return rate, the LSTM will also generate a confidence rating. GA can then take that into consideration when deciding upon budget allocation
Example: Day 1 -> {$5.50, 55%} : Price, confidence; GA will see this and try to avoid investing as it's not very confident about the price 
Why: Quantifies the fact that these are predictions, not absolute. GA can take that into account.

---Implement CLI 
Create CLI to better interact with program:
We can add an easy way to retrain model with new data.
Create graphs and lists of price predictions.
Tune hyperparameters(learning rate, budget, generations,etc..)

---Replace all vectors with std::arrays
Probably not necessary, but potential optimization.
